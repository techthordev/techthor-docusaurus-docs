This post documents a production-ready routing pattern for Firebase Hosting
that avoids redirects, preserves clean URLs, and keeps API tooling intact.

It originated from a LinkedIn discussion after repeatedly seeing `/api/**`
traffic handled via 302 redirects — a workaround that breaks DX,
auth flows, and OpenAPI tooling at scale.

The setup uses Firebase Hosting strictly as a router
and delegates API traffic to a minimal Nginx proxy running on Cloud Run.

### Why this pattern

Firebase Hosting cannot proxy arbitrary external URLs
while keeping the same origin.

Redirects solve this superficially,
but introduce new problems:

- broken API tooling
- leaking infrastructure details
- SPA router interference
- brittle frontend workarounds

This pattern solves routing at the infrastructure layer instead.

### Discussion

This pattern sparked a broader discussion on LinkedIn
around API routing in serverless setups.
